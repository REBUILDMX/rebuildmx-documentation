Incentivizing individuals/organizations/governments to implement REBUILD MX framework, through the use of smart contract.

### How It Works
Organizations, governments, or individuals that would like to make a contribution to sustainability deposits their funds into the vault. The vault is locked and can't be accessed or tampered with anyone. As soon as conditions of REBUILD MX are met (through the use of remote sensing and MULTISIG) in any given area, the funds are then unlocked and to be given to the recipient.
