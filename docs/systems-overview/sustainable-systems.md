A sustainable system adheres to a basic fundamental equation that is:

`Energy Output - Active Energy Input >= 0`

Or in layman’s term it’s:


`Energy to establish the system + Energy to maintain the system <= Energy produced by the system`

It can also be measured in terms of yield over time vs consumption over time.


`yield/time >= consumption/time`


Thus, one logical example that can be derived from above is:

`Species A rate of replenishment >= Species A rate of harvest`

For multispecies see our R&D section
