REBUILD MX is framework for an integrated system design that takes into account every possible parameter to sustain human life and the ecology while creating economic value. Essentially, it is framework consisting of systems that are able to perform optimally given its factors and constraints.

A success of a system within REBUILD Mahayana collection of systems, is measured in:
1. Caloric and energy output
2. Nutrient density per unit of caloric output
3. Water retention
4. Carbon Capture
5. Soil Quality
6. Input per unit of output
    - Energy
    - Labor
    - Time

Based on measurements above, all of the systems that qualify to be a part of REBUILD Mahayana will solve the sustainability trilemma.
- People
- Planet
- Profit

For more detailed explanations on how we are able to solve the sustainability trilemma or also known as the tripple bottom line, see [decentralized food and energy production](/decentralized-food-and-energy)


## Facts and Figures

Figures below are taken from our baseline data for our systems, thus it is still work in progress and will be improved:


### Carbon Sequestration
Our system is able to sequester 60 times more carbon than the average imperata grassland

### Time efficiency
Our system is less time consuming therefore it is much more energy efficient. The figure below compares our goat management system vs typical goat management system in Indonesia.

### Cashflow
Cashflow figure below is based on basic template of our system (baseline). It will be improved significantly once we are able to integrate more systems into our REBUILD Mahayana systems bank.
