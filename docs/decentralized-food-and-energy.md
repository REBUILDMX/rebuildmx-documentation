## Abstract
REBUILD Mahayana is a framework designed to bring a decentralized and sovereign food and energy production system in tropical parts of the world. Our system relies on the basic notion of optimizing full human use of tropical photosynthetic capability. It is our goal is to maximize the biological potential of the tropics.

The best way to maximize the biological potential of the tropics is through polyculture agroforestry systems. This is because polyculture forest systems are the most efficient way to turn sunlight into usable energy due to its nature of being stacked in both time and space.

### Recipe
Agroforest systems consist of many different elements and species that interact with one another. The selection of species and elements on any given land with its constraints and factors as well as its spatial and temporal sequence is what we call a recipe. 

Our goal is to find suitable agroforest systems and recipes that are good enough to scale. The system is considered good enough if there will be no major changes to the methodology of establishing and maintaining the system. 

### Factors and Constraints
Factors and constraints are the determinant whether or not a species is suitable for any given land. 

Finding the suitable condition for species A to grow:

```
Let w be a parameter for growing conditions for species A

Factor(A) = Mean(w1,w2,wi,...,wn)
Constraint(A) = Min(w1,w2,wi,...,wn)

Suitability(A) = Factor(A) * Constraint(A)
```

To build a recipe, multiple suitability scores for each different species needs to be accounted for. Thus: 

```
Recipe x Suitability score = Mean(Suitability(A)*Suitability(B)*Suitability(i)*...*Suitability(n))
```

Updated version on how to build a recipe and determining both factors and constrains please see [recipe generator](./R&D/recipe-generator) on our R&D section.
